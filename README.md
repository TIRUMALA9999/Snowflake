## 📌 Overview

This repository captures **Snowflake data warehousing concepts and dimensional modeling fundamentals**, focusing on **analytics-ready data architecture** rather than transactional systems.

It demonstrates my understanding of:
- **Cloud-native data warehouses (Snowflake)**
- **Dimensional modeling (fact & dimension tables)**
- **Star schema design for BI and analytics**
- Translating business questions into **analytical data models**

This knowledge is essential for **Data Engineering, Analytics Engineering, and ML feature-store design**.

# 🧪 Topics Covered (Detailed)

---

## 1️⃣ Snowflake Architecture

### Concepts Covered
- Cloud-native, fully managed data warehouse
- Separation of:
  - Storage
  - Compute
  - Cloud services
- Elastic scaling and concurrency
- Pay-as-you-go pricing model


“How is Snowflake different from traditional databases?”

---

## 2️⃣ Dimensional Modeling Fundamentals

### Concepts Covered
- Difference between OLTP and OLAP systems
- Analytical vs transactional workloads
- Why dimensional models are preferred for analytics

---

## 3️⃣ Fact Tables

### Concepts Covered
- Granularity (grain definition)
- Measures (additive, semi-additive, non-additive)
- Surrogate keys
- Fact table design best practices


“What is a fact table and how do you define its grain?”

---

## 4️⃣ Dimension Tables

### Concepts Covered
- Descriptive attributes
- Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCD – conceptual overview)
- Hierarchies (date, geography, product)
- Denormalized dimensions for query performance

---

## 5️⃣ Star Schema Design

### Concepts Covered
- Fact table at the center
- Dimensions connected via foreign keys
- Query simplicity and performance benefits
- BI tool compatibility

---

## 6️⃣ Visual Modeling Artifacts

### Included Artifacts
- **Fact–Dimension diagram (`Fact dim.drawio`)**
- **Star schema image (`dimensional_modelling image.png`)**

These diagrams demonstrate the ability to:
- Visualize data models
- Communicate architecture clearly
- Bridge technical and business understanding

---

## 🧠 How This Fits Into My Portfolio

This repository complements my work in:
- SQL & database design
- Data engineering pipelines
- BI & analytics systems
- Machine learning feature stores
- Cloud-based data platforms

It demonstrates **data modeling depth**, not just querying ability.

---

## ⚙️ How to Use This Repository

- Review **Snowflake notes** for architecture understanding
- Study **fact–dimension diagrams** to learn modeling decisions
- Apply concepts when designing:
  - Analytics warehouses
  - Feature stores
  - Reporting databases

---

## 🧾 Points 

- Studied **Snowflake cloud data warehouse architecture**, including separation of storage and compute, elastic scaling, and concurrency management.  
- Designed **dimensional data models** using **fact and dimension tables**, optimized for analytics and BI workloads.  
- Applied **star schema modeling principles** to translate business requirements into analytics-ready data structures.  
- Created **visual data models and diagrams** to communicate warehouse design clearly to technical and non-technical stakeholders.  
- Built strong foundations in **analytics engineering and data warehousing** supporting BI, ML feature stores, and cloud data platforms.

---

## 🧠 Points

- “I understand Snowflake as an analytics warehouse, not just a database.”
- “I can design star schemas starting from business questions.”
- “I know why dimensional models outperform normalized schemas for BI.”
